## ‚≠ê How setup-badge-action works

**setup-badge-action** triggers **setup-badge** workflow below.

1. **setup-badge** runs with [command line options](https://github.com/tagdots/setup-badge-action?tab=readme-ov-file#-setup-badge-command-line-options).
1. **setup-badge** adds/updates a json file from your options.
1. **setup-badge** pushes a commit to the remote branch.
1. **endpoint badge** is created with `shields.io endpoint` and `your json file`.

Now, you are ready to put the `endpoint badge` into your README file.

## üòé GitHub Action workflow examples

Use the example workflows below to create your own workflow inside `.github/workflows/`.

<br>

### Example 1Ô∏è‚É£ - summary
**setup-badge-action** will:

* run `on demand`
* create two static badges: `language` and `license`
  * language badge does not have badge url
  * license badge has a badge url that links to the LICENSE raw file

<br>

### Example 1Ô∏è‚É£ - create multiple static badges
```
name: setup-badge-action

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  language-badge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
    - id: language-badge
      uses: tagdots/setup-badge-action@3989b8b5c1c81c961b76d125c8ea50fc7739d9cf # 1.0.0
      with:
        badge-name: language
        label: Language
        message: Python
        message-color: FFA500

  license-badge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
    - id: license-badge
      uses: tagdots/setup-badge-action@3989b8b5c1c81c961b76d125c8ea50fc7739d9cf # 1.0.0
      with:
        badge-name: license
        badge-url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tagdots/setup-badge/refs/heads/main/LICENSE
        label: License
        message: MIT
        message-color: FFA500
```

<br><br>

### Example 2Ô∏è‚É£ - summary
**setup-badge-action** will:

* run `on schedule at 5:30 pm UTC` or `on demand`
* run a coverage test and get the coverage percentage from the test result
* create a dynamic `Code Coverage` badge with the coverage % that changes over time

<br>

### Example 2Ô∏è‚É£ - create a dynamic badge
```
name: setup-badge-action

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 17 * * *'

  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  coverage-badge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write

    outputs:
      COV_PER: ${{ steps.get-coverage-results.outputs.COV_PER }}

    steps:
    - id: coverage-run
      run: coverage run

    - id: get-coverage-results
      run: |
        echo "COV_PER=$(...coverage run results...)" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

    - id: coverage-badge
      uses: tagdots/setup-badge-action@3989b8b5c1c81c961b76d125c8ea50fc7739d9cf # 1.0.0
      with:
        badge-name: coverage
        label: "Code Coverage"
        message: "${{ steps.get-coverage-results.outputs.COV_PER }}"
